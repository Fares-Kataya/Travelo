From hotel amenities to their service, I can only describe it as “an experience” to stay there.  Unfortunately we went in November so we couldn’t access the beach but I heard it was amazing! The restaurant is great with lots of options that caters to every diet. Their pastry chef is definitely french pastry trained as the quality of the pastry shows! The gym is not bad but the heated indoor pool and jacuzzi are amazing! If there is one thing I felt missing was reading light so that you don’t disturb others in the room again, otherwise it is fantastic! If you get the chance to stay there, do not hesitate",

Overall, the hotel has a lot to offer, but there were some aspects that left me with mixed feelings.\n\nCleanliness and Service: 5/5\nFirst and foremost, the cleanliness of the hotel was impeccable. From the lobby to the guest rooms, everything was spotless, which is always a top priority for me when traveling. The service was another highlight; the staff was incredibly attentive and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable. They were friendly, professional, and always willing to assist with any requests.\n\nFood: 5/5\nThe dining options at the Four Seasons were exceptional. The food was delicious, with a variety of local and international dishes that catered to different tastes. Every meal I had was a delight, showcasing the culinary creativity and quality that the hotel is known for.\n\nValue for Money: 2/5\nHowever, I must mention that the price of my stay was quite steep. I paid around $1000 for one night, which I felt was excessive, especially considering it wasn't the peak season. While I appreciate the luxury experience, the cost seemed disproportionate to the amenities provided.\n\nRoom Amenities: 2/5\nAdditionally, I found the bathroom amenities lacking. Essential items like toothbrushes and toothpaste were not provided, which is something I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. It’s the small details that can make a big difference in the overall experience.\n\nOverall Impression: 3/5\nIn summary, the Four Seasons Hotel in Alexandria is a beautiful property with excellent service and fantastic food. However, the high price point and the lack of certain basic amenities may give potential guests pause. If you're looking for a luxurious getaway and don't mind the cost, this hotel could be a wonderful choice, but it's important to weigh the value against what is offered.\n\nI would recommend the hotel, but with the caveat to prepare for the premium pricing and to manage expectations regarding room amenities.",

A large group from a Moroccan team occupied many of the rooms and created an incredible amount of noise, partying until 2:00 AM. To make matters worse, at 6:00 AM, they had speakers blasting music in the corridors, dancing and shouting.\n\nDespite my complaints, the hotel staff did nothing to address the situation. I ended up having a terrible night and left feeling extremely dissatisfied with my stay .\nAdditionally I found lamps in the bathroom are not working only two was working the rest need to be change and one inside the room which added to over all discomfort .

There are also many restaurants in the mall and we thought Red Rose was clean with good food. However for more traditional Egyptian Al Nasr cafe restaurant is also good and very cheap",

						"text": "El Mahrousa Hotel – A Hidden Gem in Alexandria\n\nI had the pleasure of staying at El Mahrousa Hotel in Alexandria, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. Situated right on the Mediterranean coast, the hotel offers breathtaking sea views and a prime location that makes exploring Alexandria a breeze.\n\nThe rooms were spacious, clean, and well-maintained, with a touch of classic elegance that reflects the city's rich history. Waking up to the sound of the waves and enjoying a morning coffee on the balcony was truly a highlight of my stay.\n\nThe staff at El Mahrousa deserve special mention for their exceptional hospitality. From the moment I arrived, they went above and beyond to ensure my comfort. Whether it was providing local recommendations or accommodating special requests, they were always friendly and professional.\n\nThe hotel's restaurant serves a variety of delicious dishes, blending traditional Egyptian flavors with international cuisine. The seafood options were particularly outstanding, and the dining experience was enhanced by the serene ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature is the hotel's proximity to key attractions such as the Alexandria Library, Qaitbay Citadel, and Montazah Palace. It’s perfect for both leisure and business travelers who want convenience and comfort.\n\nOverall, El Mahrousa Hotel is a fantastic choice for anyone visiting Alexandria. It combines excellent service, stunning views, and a welcoming atmosphere to create a memorable experience. I can’t wait to return and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in this beautiful city!",
